# String Functions

## Introduction

Here's a list of what we find is missing from PHP's built-in support for string handling and manipulation.

## Available Functions

Function | Purpose
---------|--------
[`quote_index()`](quote_index.html) | surround an array key with `'` and `'` if appropriate
[`quote_property()`](quote_property.html) | surround a PHP class/object property name with `{` and `}` if it can't be safely used as a class or object property name in `eval()`
[`vnsprintf()`](vnsprintf.html) | `vsprintf()` with support for named arguments
