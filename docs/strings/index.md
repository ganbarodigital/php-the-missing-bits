# String Functions

## Introduction

Here's a list of what we find is missing from PHP's built-in support for string handling and manipulation.

## Available Functions

Function | Purpose
---------|--------
[`addbraces`](addbraces.html) | surround a string with `{` and `}` if it can't be safely used as a class or object property name in `eval()`
[vnsprintf](vnsprintf.html) | `vsprintf()` with support for named arguments
