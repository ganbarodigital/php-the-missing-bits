# Introduction

## What Is PHP: The Missing Bits?

Ganbaro Digital's _PHP: The Missing Bits_ provides functions that we wish were built into PHP itself.

## Goals

_PHP: The Missing Bits_'s purpose is to provide a home for all the single functions that we find ourselves duplicating in different libraries. These are small functions that aren't worth putting into their own packages. They're also really handly functions that we want to be available to any Composer package.

## Design Constraints

The library's design is guided by the following constraint(s):

* Every function has to be a standalone unit.
* No external dependencies.

We want this library to feel like an extension to PHP itself, and to be something that any other Composer package could reliably depend upon.
