# Introduction

## What Is PHP: The Missing Bits?

Ganbaro Digital's _PHP: The Missing Bits_ provides functionality that we wish was built into PHP itself.

## Goals

_PHP: The Missing Bits_'s purpose is to provide a home for all the single functions that we find ourselves duplicating in different libraries. These are small functions that aren't worth putting into their own packages.

## Design Constraints

The library's design is guided by the following constraint(s):

* Every function or class has to be a standalone unit.
* No external dependencies.

We want this library to feel like an extension to PHP itself, and to be something that any other Composer package could reliably depend upon.
