# Entities

## Introduction

Entities are objects that:

* hold data, and
* support changing that data after construction (normally via `setXXX()` methods)

Stock PHP doesn't include any standard way of defining entities or their common behaviours. And yet, the entity is probably the most common code pattern in applications today.
