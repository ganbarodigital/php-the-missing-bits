# Shims

## Introduction

_Shims_ provide backports of functionality. They help build bridges (and upgrade paths) between older and new versions of PHP.

Shims are normally built by the PHP community, and shipped as standalone Composer packages. We're only incorporating shims where _PHP: The Missing Bits_ can't do without them.
