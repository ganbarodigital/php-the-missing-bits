## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigitalTest\MissingBits\TraceInspectors\FilterBacktrace
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can use as object
     [x] Can call statically
     [x] Will return global functions
     [x] Will filter out namespaces
     [x] Returns first stack frame when everything else filtered out
     [x] Can search from anywhere in the stack
     [x] Returns last stack frame when starting search beyond the stack
