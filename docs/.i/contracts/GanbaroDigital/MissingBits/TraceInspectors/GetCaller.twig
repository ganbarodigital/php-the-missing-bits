## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\TraceInspectors\GetCaller
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can use as object
     [x] Can call statically
     [x] Can call as function
     [x] Can call as function without trace
     [x] Will return global functions
     [x] Will filter out namespaces
     [x] Returns first stack frame when everything else filtered out
