## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\TypeChecks\IsLogical
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can detect booleans
     [x] Can detect nulls
     [x] Rejects everything else

{% include ".i/boilerplate/behavioural-contract.twig" %}
