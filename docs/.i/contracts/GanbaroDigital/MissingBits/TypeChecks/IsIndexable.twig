## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\TypeChecks\IsIndexable
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can check for array access
     [x] Can check for array object
     [x] Rejects everything else

{% include ".i/boilerplate/behavioural-contract.twig" %}
