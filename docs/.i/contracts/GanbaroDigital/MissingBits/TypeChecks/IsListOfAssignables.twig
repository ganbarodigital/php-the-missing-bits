     [x] throws TypeError for non lists bool(true)
     [x] throws TypeError for non lists bool(false)
     [x] throws TypeError for non lists
     [x] returns true for stdClass
     [x] returns true for objects with public properties
     [x] returns false for objects without public properties
     [x] returns false for everything else
     [x] is CheckList
     [x] can use as CheckList
