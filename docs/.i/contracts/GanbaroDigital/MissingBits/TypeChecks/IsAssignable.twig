## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigitalTest\MissingBits\TypeChecks\IsAssignable
     [x] returns true for stdClass
     [x] returns true for objects with public properties
     [x] returns false for objects without public properties
     [x] returns false for everything else
     [x] is Check
     [x] can use as Check
     [x] is ListCheck
     [x] can use as ListCheck
