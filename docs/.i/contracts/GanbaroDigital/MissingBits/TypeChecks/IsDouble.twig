## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\TypeChecks\IsDouble
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can detect real doubles
     [x] Treats integers as doubles
     [x] Can detect doubles in strings
     [x] Rejects everything else
