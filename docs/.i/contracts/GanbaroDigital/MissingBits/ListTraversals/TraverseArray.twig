## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigitalTest\MissingBits\ListTraversals\TraverseArray
     [x] will traverse array
     [x] numeric keys are passed to callable
     [x] string keys are passed to callable
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException when list is not an array or Traversable

{% include ".i/boilerplate/behavioural-contract.twig" %}
