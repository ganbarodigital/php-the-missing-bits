## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigitalTest\MissingBits\ListTraversals\TraverseList
     [x] will traverse array
     [x] will treat Traversable as array
     [x] array numeric keys are passed to callable
     [x] array string keys are passed to callable
     [x] will traverse object
     [x] object numeric property names are passed to callable
     [x] object string property names are passed to callable
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException when list is not an arry or object
