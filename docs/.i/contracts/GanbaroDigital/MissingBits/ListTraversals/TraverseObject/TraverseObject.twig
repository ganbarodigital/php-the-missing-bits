## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\ListTraversals\TraverseObject\TraverseObject
     [x] will traverse object
     [x] numeric property names are passed to callable
     [x] string property names are passed to callable
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException when list is not an object

{% include ".i/boilerplate/behavioural-contract.twig" %}
