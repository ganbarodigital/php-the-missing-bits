## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\ClassesAndObjects\FilterObjectProperties
     [x] returns empty array if object has no non static properties
     [x] returns list of non static properties
     [x] returned list includes parent classes non static properties
     [x] returned list includes traits non static properties
     [x] returned list includes parent classes and traits non static properties
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException for non objects
