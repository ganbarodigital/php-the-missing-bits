## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigitalTest\MissingBits\Entities\WriteProtectTab
     [x] starts in read write
     [x] can write protect
     [x] can enforce write protection
     [x] can write enable
     [x] can enforce read only forever protection
