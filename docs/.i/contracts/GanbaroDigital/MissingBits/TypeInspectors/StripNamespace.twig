## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\TypeInspectors\StripNamespace
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can use as object
     [x] Can call statically
     [x] Can call as function
     [x] Strips namespaces from classes
     [x] Strips namespaces from objects
     [x] Returns class name for classes with no namespace
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException if class not defined
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException for everything else
