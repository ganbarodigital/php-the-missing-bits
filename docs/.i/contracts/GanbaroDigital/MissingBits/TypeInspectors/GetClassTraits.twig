## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigital\MissingBits\TypeInspectors\GetClassTraits
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can use as object
     [x] Can call statically
     [x] Can call as function
     [x] Detects traits used by classes
     [x] Detects traits used by objects
     [x] Returns empty array for everything else
