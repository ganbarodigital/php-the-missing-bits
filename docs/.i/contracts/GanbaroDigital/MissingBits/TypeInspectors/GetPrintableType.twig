## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    GanbaroDigitalTest\MissingBits\TypeInspectors\GetPrintableType
     [x] Can instantiate
     [x] Can use as object
     [x] Can call statically
     [x] Can call as function
     [x] Will use default flags if invalid flags provided
