## Behavoural Contract

Here is the behavioural contract, enforced by our unit tests:

    has_object_properties()
     [x] returns false if object has no non static properties
     [x] returns true if object has non static properties
     [x] throws InvalidArgumentException for non objects

{% include ".i/boilerplate/behavioural-contract.twig" %}
