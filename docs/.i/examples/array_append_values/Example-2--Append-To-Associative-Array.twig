### Example 2: Append To Associative Array

This example shows what happens when we use <code>array_append_values()</code>
to append to an associative array.

As you can see, the result isn't all that useful!

```php
$target = [
    "fish" => "trout",
    "name" => "harry"
];

$extra = [
    "fish" => "salmon",
    "name" => "sally"
];

$newList = array_append_values($target, $extra);
var_dump($newList);
```
The code above produces this output on PHP v5.6.30, PHP v7.0.19, PHP v7.1.5:

```
array(4) {
  ["fish"]=>
  string(5) "trout"
  ["name"]=>
  string(5) "harry"
  [0]=>
  string(6) "salmon"
  [1]=>
  string(5) "sally"
}
```
