Class contracts are built from this class's unit tests.

<div class="callout success">
Future releases of this class will not break this contract.
</div>

<div class="callout info" markdown="1">
Future releases of this class may add to this contract. New additions may include:

* clarifying existing behaviour (e.g. stricter contract around input or return types)
* add new behaviours (e.g. extra class methods)
</div>

<div class="callout warning" markdown="1">
When you use this class, you can only rely on the behaviours documented by this contract.

If you:

* find other ways to use this class,
* or depend on behaviours that are not covered by a unit test,
* or depend on undocumented internal states of this class,

... your code may not work in the future.
